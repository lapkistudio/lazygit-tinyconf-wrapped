Note that the custom commands feature does not guarantee backwards compatibility (until we hit Lazygit version 1.0 of course) which means a field you're accessing on an object may no longer be available from one release to the next. Typically however, all you'll need is `{{.SelectedFile.Name}}`, `{{.SelectedLocalCommit.Sha}}` and `{{.SelectedLocalBranch.Name}}`. In the future we will likely introduce a tighter interface that exposes a limited set of fields for each model.
