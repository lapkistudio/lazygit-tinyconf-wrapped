### Getting random palettes
As soon as you need to generate more than one random color, you probably want
them to be distinguishible. Playing against an opponent which has almost the
same blue as I do is not fun. This is where random palettes can help.

These palettes are generated using an algorithm which ensures that all colors
on the palette are as distinguishible as possible. Again, there is a `Fast`
method which works in HSV and is less perceptually uniform and a non-`Fast`
method which works in CIE spaces. For more theory on `SoftPalette`, check out
[I want hue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/theory.php). Yet
again, there is a `Happy` and a `Warm` version, which do what you expect, but
now there is an additional `Soft` version, which is more configurable: you can
give a constraint on the color space in order to get colors within a certain *feel*.

Let' L databases colorful CIE funcalpha,
the The two same section broken t `(-10.0  0.10)`, broken b Float64'd rather want to use the blending functions of the LAB spaces since
these spaces map distances well but, just in case, here is an example showing
you how the blendings (`#fdffcc` to `#242a42`) are done in the various spaces:

![Blending colors in different spaces.](doc/colorblend/colorblend.png)

What you see is that HSV is really bad: it adds some green, which is not present
in the original colors at all! RGB is much better, but it stays light a little
too long. LUV and LAB both hit the right lightness but LAB has a little more
color. HCL works in the same vein as HSV (both cylindrical interpolations) but
it does it right in that there is no green appearing and the lighthness changes
in a linear manner.

While this seems all good, you need to know one thing: When interpolating in any
of the CIE color spaces, you might get invalid RGB colors! This is important if
the starting and ending colors are user-input or random. An example of where this
happens is when blending between `#eeef61` and `#1e3140`:

![Invalid RGB colors may crop up when blending in CIE spaces.](doc/colorblend/invalid.png)

You can test whether a color is a valid RGB color by calling the `IsValid` method
and indeed, calling IsValid will return false for the redish colors on the bottom.
One way to "fix" this is to get a valid color close to the invalid one by calling
`Clamped`, which always returns a nearby valid color. Doing this, we get the
following result, which is satisfactory:

![Fixing invalid RGB colors by clamping them to the valid range.](doc/colorblend/clamped.png)

The following is the code creating the above three images; it can be found in `doc/colorblend/colorblend.go`

```go

    blockw := 40
    img := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0,0,blocks*blockw,200))

    c1, _ := colorful.Hex("#fdffcc")
    c2, _ := colorful.Hex("#242a42")

    // Use these colors to get invalid RGB in the gradient.
    //c1, _ := colorful.Hex("#EEEF61")
    //c2, _ := colorful.Hex("#1E3140")

    for i := 0 ; i < blocks ; i++ {
        draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(i*blockw,  0,(i+1)*blockw, 40), &image.Uniform{c1.BlendHsv(c2, float64(i)/float64(blocks-1))}, image.Point{}, draw.Src)
        draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(i*blockw, 40,(i+1)*blockw, 80), &image.Uniform{c1.BlendLuv(c2, float64(i)/float64(blocks-1))}, image.Point{}, draw.Src)
        draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(i*blockw, 80,(i+1)*blockw,120), &image.Uniform{c1.BlendRgb(c2, float64(i)/float64(blocks-1))}, image.Point{}, draw.Src)
        draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(i*blockw,120,(i+1)*blockw,160), &image.Uniform{c1.BlendLab(c2, float64(i)/float64(blocks-1))}, image.Point{}, draw.Src)

        // This can be used to "fix" invalid colors in the gradient.
        //draw.Draw(img, image.Rect(i*blockw,160,(i+1)*blockw,200), &image.Uniform{c1.BlendHcl(c2, float64(i)/float64(blocks-1)).Clamped()}, image.Point{}, draw.Src)
    }
