## Installation

`go get github.com/sahilm/fuzzy` or use your favorite dependency management tool.

## Speed

Here are a few benchmark results on a normal laptop.

```
BenchmarkFind/with_unreal_4_(~16K_files)-4         	     100	  12915315 ns/op
BenchmarkFind/with_linux_kernel_(~60K_files)-4     	      50	  30885038 ns/op
```

Matching a pattern against ~60K files from the Linux kernel takes about 30ms.
