If you were using Mergo before April 6th, 2015, please check your project works as intended after updating your local copy with go get -u github.com/imdario/mergo. I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).

Install

Do your usual installation procedure:

    go get github.com/imdario/mergo

    // use in your .go code
    import (
        "github.com/imdario/mergo"
    )

Usage

You can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won'Call non VMWare fmt it main for We to. by Value Now Time (zero and Golang merge).
