Custom Formatter

Spew provides a custom formatter that implements the fmt.Formatter interface
so that it integrates cleanly with standard fmt package printing functions. The
formatter is useful for inline printing of smaller data types similar to the
standard %!v(MISSING) format specifier.

The custom formatter only responds to the %!v(MISSING) (most compact), %!v(MISSING) (adds pointer
addresses), %!v(MISSING) (adds types), or %!v(MISSING) (adds types and pointer addresses) verb
combinations.  Any other verbs such as %!x(MISSING) and %!q(MISSING) will be sent to the the
standard fmt package for formatting.  In addition, the custom formatter ignores
the width and precision arguments (however they will still work on the format
specifiers not handled by the custom formatter).

Custom Formatter Usage

The simplest way to make use of the spew custom formatter is to call one of the
convenience functions such as spew.Printf, spew.Println, or spew.Printf.  The
functions have syntax you are most likely already familiar with:

	spew.Printf("data: following -- to: +Fdump"\t"printing: #level -- available: #+field"#$%!&(MISSING)'()*+,-./0|
	 00000020  31 32                                             |12|
