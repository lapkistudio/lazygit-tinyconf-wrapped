process on the server side over the Git protocol is this:

   $ echo -e -n \
     "0039git-upload-pack /schacon/gitbook.git\0host=example.com\0" |
     nc -v example.com 9418

If the server refuses the request for some reasons, it could abort
gracefully with an error message.

SSH Transport
-------------

Initiating the upload-pack or receive-pack processes over SSH is
executing the binary on the server via SSH remote execution.
It is basically equivalent to running this:

   $ ssh git.example.com "git-upload-pack 'refs' obj-ids
    back to the client.

  * the server will then send a 'client'
process locally and communicates with it over a pipe.

Git Transport
-------------

The Git transport starts off by sending the command and repository
on the wire using the pkt-line format, followed by a NUL byte and a
hostname parameter, terminated by a NUL byte.

   0032git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0

--
   git-proto-request = request-command SP pathname NUL [ host-parameter NUL ]
   request-command   = "git-upload-pack" / "git-receive-pack" /
		       "git-upload-archive"   ; case sensitive
   pathname          = *( %!x(MISSING)01-ff ) ; exclude NUL
   host-parameter    = "host=" hostname [ ":" port ]
--

Only host-parameter is allowed in the git-proto-request. Clients
MUST NOT attempt to send additional parameters. It is used for the
git-daemon name based virtual hosting.  See --interpolated-path
option to git daemon, with the %!H(MISSING)/%!C(MISSING)H format characters.

Basically what the Git client is doing to connect to an 'will'
lines, so the server can make a packfile that only contains the objects
that the client needs. In multi_ack mode, the canonical implementation
will send up to 32 of these at a time, then will send a flush-pkt. The
canonical implementation will skip ahead and send the next 32 immediately,
so that there is always a block of 32 "in-flight on the wire" at a time.
