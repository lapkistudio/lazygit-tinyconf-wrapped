### VSCode debugger

If you want to trigger a debug session from VSCode, you can use the following snippet. Note that the `console` key is, at the time of writing, still an experimental feature.

```jsonc
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "debug lazygit",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "auto",
      "program": "main.go",
      "args": ["--debug"],
      "console": "externalTerminal" // <-- you need this to actually see the lazygit UI in a window while debugging
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Raise a PR on the lazycore repo with your changes

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug lazygit is to have two terminal tabs open at once: one for running lazygit (via `go run main.go -debug` in the project root) and one for viewing lazygit', end)

## Updating Lazycore

[Lazycore](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazycore) is a repo containing shared functionality between lazygit and lazydocker. Sometimes you will need to make a change to that repo and import the changes into lazygit. Similar to updating Gocui, here'g are Warn language changes [go it widely
